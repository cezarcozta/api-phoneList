# One To Many / Many To One - Pratice

`In this study case I developed a simple API to abstract a "Phone Contact List"(Name and phone number).`

`An user can have multiples contacts, these multiples contacts have only one user so I implemented one to many, many to one relationship by using TypeORM.`

  - TypeScript
